There are 26 bones or vertebrae that make up the spinal column and they are
each cushioned by disks. Each disk is made up of two parts, a soft, gelatinous
portion inside along with a tough outer ring. These disks are shock absorbers
and help prevent damage during movement and in particular loading a movement,
such as squatting.  A herniation or slipped disk occurs when the soft portion
protrudes through the tough outer ring causing severe discomfort. There may
also be numbness and pain associated if the disk compresses one of your spinal
nerves.

No one asks for a herniated disk, but this is the risk you take when you load
the squat bar for a 1 rep max. Your core will alway go before your legs and
these heavy loads can put a great strain on your lower back improving your risk
of a slipped disk. 

A safer alternative to a 1 rep max is a 3-5 rep technical failure max.
Technical failure is when form or technique breaks down and compensating
begins, basically, the squat just gets ugly. To minimize breakdown in the
squat, optimize your hip, thoracic-spine, and ankle mobility and train for
stability through your core.  Form over weight should always be the goal and
wearing a weight belt along with a spotter will also help maintain the
integrity of the squat.

Popular rep-max calulations are online and available (we recently built a free
[free 1 rep-max calculator](http://1rm.io)). O'Conners seems to be well accepted
rep max formula, as well as the Bryzicki formula. The NSCA published some
coefficients to be used for different lifts as well.
