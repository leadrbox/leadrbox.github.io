Can crawling like a baby really help your back feel better?

I’ve been reading this book called "Becoming the Super Hero You Were Meant to
Be". In the book there is this amazing story about Karen who lost her
sternocleidomastoid as a result of thyroid cancer. After 6 months of
rehabilitation, she still had pain and dysfunction. She was then told to crawl
backward, and does this for two days. The result: The pain and dysfunction were
completely gone. Crawling also strengthens the wrists, trains the rotator cuff,
and “greases” tight, sticky hips along with connecting the brain and body to
promote efficient movement. I use crawling as a reset at both the beginning and
end of a training session. Athletes continue to comment on how good they feel,
in particular, how “loose” their lower back feels.

A week ago, I had a trainer complain of sciatic nerve pain. She told me she had
spent time rolling out, but still had significant discomfort. I suggested a
loaded leopard crawl, so with some skepticism, she crawled 10 yards forward and
backward. When she stood up, she was amazed at how much better she felt. She
could stand and balance on one leg, which was something she wasn’t able to do
without pain. She was in amazed at how such a simple movement could help her
feel so much better. So next time you have a tight low back, try loaded
crawling forward and backward 10 yards. Watch the video below to see some of
the crawling progressions, as well as, loaded crawling. For more information on
the different forms of crawling, purchase the book at
