Gray Cook and Lee Burton introduced me to primitive movement patterns, which
begin with rolling, pushing up, quadruped and evolve to crawling, and
ultimately leads to finding the nearest piece of furniture to pull yourself up
on.  And, so squatting begins, from the bottom up. The squatting pattern should
be practiced by every athlete, everyday; however, loading the squat is not a
one-size-fits-all exercise.

Practicing the squat pattern from the bottom up forces you to earn the
stability it will take to squat with heavy loads, but perfecting the squat is
much more than bending your knees with a bar on your back. You must have good
thoracic, hip, and ankle mobility along with lumbar and knee stability to
minimize risk and maximize results. Addressing these areas will not only help
you perfect the squat, but also reduce your injuries outside the weight room. 

Addressing ankle mobility issues; specifically dorsi flexion issues, can help
improve your squat quality and limit knee pain. Ankle mobility starts with
performing self myofascial release using a foam roller or pvc pipe on the
posterior, lateral and medial sides of the calf.  You will be on an expedition,
searching for trigger points. Once you find a trigger point, tender area, spend
10-12 seconds and then roll out the entire length of the calf. Continue to do
so for 30-40 seconds on the medial and then lateral side of the calf. Adding
movement to your foot and ankle, such as drawing the alphabet in capital
letters with your foot, can add an additional mobility benefit while rolling
out.

Starting with the [FMS toe touch
progression](http://www.functionalmovement.com/exercises/toe_touch_progression)
and then elevating your heels from 1 1/4” to 2” can help those with ankle
mobility issues and perform the squat pattern with higher quality.
