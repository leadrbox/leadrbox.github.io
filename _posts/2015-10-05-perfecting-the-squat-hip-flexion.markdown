Simply put, if you’re short in the front and weak in the backside, then hip
flexion will cause problems

The hips are a very powerful joint and have the ability to extend, adduct,
abduct, rotate, and flex.  For the purpose of this article, we are going to
focus on hip flexion and its role in perfecting the squat.  To maximize squat
depth and minimize lumbar extension, you need 110-130 degrees of hip flexion.
Improving hip flexion and overall hip mobility starts with addressing
structural, muscular, and capsular issues. 

We are going to start by addressing short, tight hip flexors, weak glutes, and
tight lumbar erectors:  These lead to an anterior pelvic tilt and, in turn,
they affect the fit of the femoral head in the cup-shaped cavity of the pelvis
which is known as the “acetabulum.”. Addressing muscular restrictions in the
iliopsoas, glutes, and hamstrings using myofascial release tools and applied
pressure for 45-60 seconds can restore tissue quality.  Once the tissue quality
is restored, we will turn our attention to the joint capsule. The capsule can
become stiff and tight and develop “sticking points.”  So we must decompress or
“unglue” the hip joint so that the femur bone is able to posteriorly slide
during hip flexion.  Performing some hip mobilization will allow the femur to
slide freely within the acetabulum.

Alright lets test your hip flexion. Lie on your back and bring your knee to
your waist without lifting the opposite knee, or externally rotating your
opposite foot.  Next, follow the video and see how much your hip flexion
improves.

I saw this “tool” on a Kelly Starrett video. I wasn’t sure how they made it,
but I taped four tennis balls together as a base and then placed a lacrosse
ball in the middle. I call this “the smasher” and use it for hamstrings and the
illopsoas.
