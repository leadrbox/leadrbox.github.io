Hi, I'm Jason, one of the founders of Leadrbox. We are excited to be able to
share tips, success stories, and news here  on the blog over the next days,
weeks, and months.

We are focused on making the lives and efforts of athletes and trainers more
effective. Circle back from time to time, or subscribe to the [the RSS
feed](/feed.xml) if you're into that sort of thing.

Stay tuned as we'll be sharing tips here on the blog.
