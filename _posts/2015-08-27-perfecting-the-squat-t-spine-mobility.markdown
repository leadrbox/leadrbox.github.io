The heels are down, hips are back, and the knees are tracking correctly.  The
back squat “looks” good, so why does the back hurt?  One issue could exist with
a poor overhead squat.  You ask, “What does the overhead squat have to do with
a traditional back or front squat?”  Well, those lacking thoracic extension and
rotation will gain the needed extension through the lumbar, increasing the
anterior tilt of the hips, which leads to tightness in the lumbar area and
possible pain as a consequence.  Poor thoracic mobility can also affect the
shoulder and neck.  So even if the overhead squat is not a part of your
program, addressing the overhead squatting movement, along with thoracic
mobility, will improve your front and back squat and will reduce tightness in
the lower back during these movements. 

Improving thoracic mobility begins with improving the tissue quality in this
area.  Poor tissue quality is a combination of dehydration and repeated
movements causing binding of the muscle and fascia, the collagenous web that
surrounds, supports, and connects all of our muscles.  This combination limits
the muscles’ ability to lengthen and ultimately perform.  Applying pressure to
these adhesions or trigger points using a combination of a foam roller and “the
peanut” will help to break up the fascia and release the muscle so it can
perform as it should.

Improve your Thoracic Spine mobility in 2 minutes. First, test your overhead
squat, then follow the video and retest your overhead squat to see the
difference.
