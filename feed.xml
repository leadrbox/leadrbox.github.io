        <title>Perfecting the Squat: Ankle Mobility</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.blog.leadrbox.com.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/squats/lady_squat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;squats&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray Cook and Lee Burton introduced me to primitive movement patterns, which
begin with rolling, pushing up, quadruped and evolve to crawling, and
ultimately leads to finding the nearest piece of furniture to pull yourself up
on.  And, so squatting begins, from the bottom up. The squatting pattern should
be practiced by every athlete, everyday; however, loading the squat is not a
one-size-fits-all exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practicing the squat pattern from the bottom up forces you to earn the
stability it will take to squat with heavy loads, but perfecting the squat is
much more than bending your knees with a bar on your back. You must have good
thoracic, hip, and ankle mobility along with lumbar and knee stability to
minimize risk and maximize results. Addressing these areas will not only help
you perfect the squat, but also reduce your injuries outside the weight room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing ankle mobility issues; specifically dorsi flexion issues, can help
improve your squat quality and limit knee pain. Ankle mobility starts with
performing self myofascial release using a foam roller or pvc pipe on the
posterior, lateral and medial sides of the calf.  You will be on an expedition,
searching for trigger points. Once you find a trigger point, tender area, spend
10-12 seconds and then roll out the entire length of the calf. Continue to do
so for 30-40 seconds on the medial and then lateral side of the calf. Adding
movement to your foot and ankle, such as drawing the alphabet in capital
letters with your foot, can add an additional mobility benefit while rolling
out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.functionalmovement.com/exercises/toe_touch_progression&quot;&gt;FMS toe touch
progression&lt;/a&gt;
and then elevating your heels from 1 1/4” to 2” can help those with ankle
mobility issues and perform the squat pattern with higher quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;framed-img&quot;&gt;
  1) The squatting pattern starts with the toe touch
  &lt;img alt=&quot;squats start with the toe touch&quot; src=&quot;http://assets.blog.leadrbox.com.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/squats/squat_position_1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;framed-img&quot;&gt;
  2) Squat pushing the knees out with your elbow
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.blog.leadrbox.com.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/squats/squat_position_2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;framed-img&quot;&gt;
  3) One arm over head

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;framed-img&quot;&gt;
  4) The other arm overhead

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;framed-img&quot;&gt;
  5) Stand up with your arms overhead

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice the squat and then go through the video routine below and to see if your squat quality improves.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>&quot;I want to herniate a disk&quot; -- said no one ever</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a coach, there is nothing better than witnessing an athlete’s smile after
they have set a personal record. Traditionally personal records are set with a
1 rep max, but with this comes risk. I have gone away from a 1 rep max to a 3-5
rep technical failure max and have still witnessed plenty of ear to ear grins.
As a coach my first goal is to minimize risk in the weight room and challenging
athletes with a 3-5 technical failure rep max has done that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.blog.leadrbox.com.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/maxresdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1 rep max squats can be dangerous&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 26 bones or vertebrae that make up the spinal column and they are
each cushioned by disks. Each disk is made up of two parts, a soft, gelatinous
portion inside along with a tough outer ring. These disks are shock absorbers
and help prevent damage during movement and in particular loading a movement,
such as squatting.  A herniation or slipped disk occurs when the soft portion
protrudes through the tough outer ring causing severe discomfort. There may
also be numbness and pain associated if the disk compresses one of your spinal
nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one asks for a herniated disk, but this is the risk you take when you load
the squat bar for a 1 rep max. Your core will alway go before your legs and
these heavy loads can put a great strain on your lower back improving your risk
of a slipped disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A safer alternative to a 1 rep max is a 3-5 rep technical failure max.
Technical failure is when form or technique breaks down and compensating
begins, basically, the squat just gets ugly. To minimize breakdown in the
squat, optimize your hip, thoracic-spine, and ankle mobility and train for
stability through your core.  Form over weight should always be the goal and
wearing a weight belt along with a spotter will also help maintain the
integrity of the squat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still want to know what your athlete’s 1 rep max is? Try using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://1rm.io&quot;&gt;free 1
rep-max calculator&lt;/a&gt; to calculate a 1 rep max for a given number
of reps at a specific weight.&lt;/p&gt;
